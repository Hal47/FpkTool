Drag and drop a file to unpack the file, drag and drop an extracted folder to repack it. Folders can also be compared via command line in order to create a dictionary for storing the stripped filenames the .ice version used to have (First folder should be unnamed files extracted wtih the tool, second should have the named files from ice.exe etc).
